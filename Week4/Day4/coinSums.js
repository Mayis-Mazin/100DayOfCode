/*
In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:
1p piece
2p piece
5p piece
10p piece
20p piece
50p piece
1 euro (100p)
2 euro (200p)
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
1 * £1 + 1 * 50p + 2 * 20p + 1 * 5p + 1 * 2p + 3 * 1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
example usage of `makeChange`:
// aka, there's only one way to make 1p. that's with a single 1p piece
makeChange(1) === 1
// aka, there's only two ways to make 2p. that's with two, 1p pieces or with a single 2p piece
makeChange(2) === 2
*/

var makeChange = function (total) {
    if (arguments.length < 1 || typeof total !== 'number') {
      throw new Error('Need to provide a numeric value');
    }
  
    var inner = function (total, coins) {
      // base cases
      if (total < 0) {
        return 0;
      } else if (total === 0) {
        return 1;
      }
  
      var result = 0;
      var i, temp;
  
      /*
       * As an example, if total === 16, then what you want to calculate is the sum of the following:
       * 1) The number of ways to use one 10 coin and makeChange(6, with only coins less than or equal to 10)
       * 2) The number of ways to use one 5 coin and makeChange(11, with only coins less than or equal to 5)
       * 3) The number of ways to use one 2 coin and makeChange(14, with only coins less than or equal to 2)
       * 4) The number of ways to use one 1 coin and makeChange(15, with only coins less than or equal to 1)
       * The reason you have to stipulate what coins are available to use is because by doing so, you avoid
       * double counting the combinations.

      for (i = 0; i < coins.length; i += 1) {

        result += inner( total - coins[i], coinsAvailable(coins[i]) );
