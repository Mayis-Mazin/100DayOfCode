/**
 * 100 DAY OF Code
 * Day4: Bubble Sort 
 */

/*
 * Bubble sort is the most basic sorting algorithm in all of Computer
 * Sciencedom. It works by starting at the first element of an array and
 * comparing it to the second element; if the first element is greater than the
 * second element, it swaps the two. It then compares the second to the third,
 * and the third to the fourth, and so on; in this way, the largest values
 * "bubble" to the end of the array. Once it gets to the end of the array, it
 * starts over and repeats the process until the array is sorted numerically.
 *
 * Implement a function that takes an array and sorts it using this technique.
 * Don't use JavaScript's built-in sorting function (Array.prototype.sort).
