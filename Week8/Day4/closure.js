/**
 * What are closures in javaScript and how and where to use them.  
 * So what is closure in javascript?
 * "whenever you declare a function inside another function, the
 *  inside function(s) is/are recreated again each time the outside function is called"
 * "Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the
 *  function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created."
 * Closures are nothing but FUNCTIONS WITH PRESERVED DATA"
